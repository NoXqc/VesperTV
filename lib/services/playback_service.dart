/// Owns the single, app-wide [VideoPlayerHdrController] for whatever channel

///
/// Was a plain `VideoPlayerController` (the stock `video_player` package) —
/// switched after a long, evidence-backed diagnosis of a real bug: on
/// Android, going fullscreen showed solid black while the exact same
/// stream played fine in a smaller inline preview elsewhere in the app,
/// even though the decoder logs showed successful decoding the entire
/// time (confirmed via logcat on real Formuler and Firestick hardware). A
/// side-by-side comparison against a native player app on the same
/// hardware showed identical MediaCodec-level success in both — the
/// difference was specifically in how each *displays* the decoded frame,
/// not decoding itself. `video_player`'s Android implementation renders
/// through a GPU-texture path that has a known, documented weakness here;
/// `video_player_hdr` is a drop-in-API fork that can render through a
/// platform view instead, closer to how a native app's own `SurfaceView`
/// works. `EnableImpeller` (Flutter's newer renderer, which fixes this
/// properly) can't be turned on here — it crashes on startup on this
/// hardware's GPU driver (see AndroidManifest.xml) — so this is the
/// practical way to get the same effective fix without it.
///
/// Previously each screen (the inline pane, the fullscreen player) created
/// and disposed its own controller, so navigating back from fullscreen on a
/// phone killed playback entirely — there was nothing left to resume into.
/// Hoisting the controller up here means any number of presentation widgets
/// (the inline pane, the fullscreen screen, a mini-player bar) can all watch
/// the same live controller — switching between them is just a different
/// wrapper around the same video, never a restart.
