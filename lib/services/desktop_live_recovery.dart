/// connection refused the new one, and the picture stayed black (LOG-FZXE2W,

///
/// Now: ended / error / stuck buffering -> "Reconnecting..." -> wait
/// (2, 4, 8, 15, 30 s) -> reopen; from the third try the channel's other
/// copies (4K -> FHD -> HD, Settings' automatic failover) when there are any.
/// Success = playback moving again; after 8 tries the message says so and a
/// retry still runs every 30 s while the channel stays on screen.
