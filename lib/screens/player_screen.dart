/// Fullscreen playback screen. Pushed when a channel is tapped on a phone,
/// or when the mini-player bar is tapped to expand back into fullscreen —
/// either way it attaches to the same shared [PlaybackService] controller,
/// so it never restarts playback that's already running.
///
/// Also owns the actual "fullscreen" behavior other apps mean by that word:
/// landscape orientation + hidden system bars ([_toggleImmersive]) — but
/// only the "hidden system bars" half of that on a TV-sized screen. A TV
/// never physically rotates, so forcing an orientation there does nothing
/// useful and can actively backfire: [AppPreferences.layoutMode] "auto"
/// (see main.dart) picks the TV UI vs. phone UI based on
/// `MediaQuery.size.width`, and forcing `portraitUp` on restore was
/// observed to shrink that reported width enough to flip the *entire app*
/// into the phone layout after leaving fullscreen on a TV box. Orientation
/// is now only ever touched when [_isTvLayout] is false.
///
/// D-pad navigation is a small explicit state machine rather than default
/// focus traversal, mirroring the fix applied to [TvHomeScreen]'s columns:
/// - **Left** (live only, no bar focused) opens [PlayerSidePanel] — Last
///   channels / My Teams / Live now. It used to exit back to the list; the
///   owner moved that to Back only (2026-10-14).
/// - **Up** first reveals the top bar (back/search/fullscreen + the
///   current/next EPG line for live channels); pressed again, it moves
///   focus onto the back button so Left/Right can reach Search too.
/// - **Down** does the same for the bottom bar (title/seek bar/play-pause);
///   once focus is inside it with nowhere further to move, a further Down
///   reveals `PlayerControls`'s own secondary action row (Recall/Reload/
///   audio track/linked-channel) — see [_moreVisible].
/// Both bars auto-hide after inactivity so they can't permanently trap the
/// D-pad the way the seek bar used to.
