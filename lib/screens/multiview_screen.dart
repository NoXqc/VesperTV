/// TV-remote-first multiview grid — several live channels playing at
/// once, one with audio focus at a time. Same idea/UX as
/// `DesktopMultiviewScreen` (Windows), independently implemented here
/// against `video_player_hdr` instead of `media_kit` — there is no
/// cross-platform video engine in this app (see `pubspec.yaml`'s
/// media_kit comment), so each platform needs its own.
///
/// Worth naming plainly: `video_player_hdr` can render via a platform view
/// (adopted elsewhere in this app, see `playback_service.dart`'s own doc
/// comment, specifically to dodge an Android GPU-texture rendering bug on
/// a *single* fullscreen stream) or a plain texture. This screen uses
/// [VideoViewType.textureView], not platform views — confirmed directly on
/// real hardware (a Formuler) via a live CPU/thread dump during a glitch:
/// with 3-4 simultaneous platform views, the app alone was pegging ~94%
/// of a CPU core concentrated in the main thread/RenderThread/GC, not any
/// audio or video codec thread — the signature of Android's hybrid-
/// composition overhead for multiple concurrent platform views, not an
/// actual decode bottleneck. A plain texture is a cheap GPU blit per
/// instance instead, which is exactly the "many simultaneous small tiles"
/// shape this screen has (the opposite of the single large fullscreen
/// view platform-view rendering was adopted for elsewhere).
///
/// 2026-11-03: with the native video surface on (the default), each screen
/// is still a texture-view player but draws into its own SurfaceView behind
/// Flutter ([NativeMultiviewTiles], [multiviewVideo]) — the texture path
/// capped 3 screens at ~7 fps each (LOG-C47KFD). Off = textures as before.
/// The same LOG and TiviMate on the owner's Formuler showed the real limit
/// is the box's H.264 decoder (~120 frames/s of 1080p for all screens, one
/// 4K stream at a time).
///
/// Full screen and Enlarge are layouts, not routes: one tile, one
/// controller, one video view that slides to its new place
/// ([multiviewSlotRects]); nothing renders the same stream twice.
/// What Back from Multiview hands the full-screen player (`PlayerScreen`):
/// the screen with the sound. [controller] is set when that screen is the
