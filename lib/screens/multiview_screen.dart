/// TV-remote-first multiview grid — several live channels playing at
/// once, one with audio focus at a time. Same idea/UX as
/// `DesktopMultiviewScreen` (Windows), independently implemented here
/// against `video_player_hdr` instead of `media_kit` — there is no
/// cross-platform video engine in this app (see `pubspec.yaml`'s
/// media_kit comment), so each platform needs its own.
///
/// Worth naming plainly: `video_player_hdr` can render via a platform view
/// (adopted elsewhere in this app, see `playback_service.dart`'s own doc
/// comment, specifically to dodge an Android GPU-texture rendering bug on
/// a *single* fullscreen stream) or a plain texture. This screen uses
/// [VideoViewType.textureView], not platform views — confirmed directly on
/// real hardware (a Formuler) via a live CPU/thread dump during a glitch:
/// with 3-4 simultaneous platform views, the app alone was pegging ~94%
/// of a CPU core concentrated in the main thread/RenderThread/GC, not any
/// audio or video codec thread — the signature of Android's hybrid-
/// composition overhead for multiple concurrent platform views, not an
/// actual decode bottleneck. A plain texture is a cheap GPU blit per
/// instance instead, which is exactly the "many simultaneous small tiles"
/// shape this screen has (the opposite of the single large fullscreen
/// view platform-view rendering was adopted for elsewhere).
///
/// This re-opens a different, already-fixed bug's risk, though: this
/// app has documented history of a *shared-decode-session* texture bug on
/// real Fire Stick hardware (see `LiveResumeHint`'s doc comment — the
/// scrapped "Live Island" pill: one decode session rendered in two places
/// at once corrupted both). [_MultiviewFullscreenView] reuses a cell's
/// already-playing controller rather than starting a second decode
/// session, but the grid's own cell tile stays mounted underneath while
/// that route is pushed on top (`Navigator.push` doesn't unmount the
/// previous route) — the same two-simultaneous-consumers shape. Needs
/// real-hardware verification specifically on that promote-to-fullscreen
/// flow, the same as everything else in this app.
